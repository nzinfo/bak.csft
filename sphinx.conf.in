	# query range setup
	#
	# useful to avoid MyISAM table locks and big result sets
	# when indexing lots of data
	#
	# to use query ranges, you should
	# 1) provide a query to fetch min/max id (ie. id range) from data set;
	# 2) configure step size in which this range will be walked;
	# 3) use $start and $end macros somewhere in the main fetch query.
	#
	# 'sql_query_range' must return exactly two integer fields
	# in exactly min_id, max_id order
	#
	# 'sql_range_step' must be a positive integer
	# optional, default is 1024
	#
	# 'sql_query' must contain both '$start' and '$end' macros
	# if you are using query ranges (because it obviously would be an
	# error to index the whole table many times)
	#
	# note that the intervals specified by $start/$end do not
	# overlap, so you should NOT remove document ids which are exactly
	# equal to $start or $end in your query
	#
	# here's an example which will index 'documents' table
	# fetching (at most) one thousand entries at a time:
	#
	# sql_query_range		= SELECT MIN(id),MAX(id) FROM documents
	# sql_range_step		= 1000
	# sql_query			= \
	#	SELECT doc.id, doc.id AS group, doc.title, doc.data \
	#	FROM documents doc \
	#	WHERE id>=$start AND id<=$end


	# attribute columns
	#
	# attribute values MUST be non-negative 32-bit integers
	# (negative values will be wrapped around)
	#
	# attributes are additional values associated with each document which
	# may be used to perform additional filtering and sorting during search.
	# attributes are NOT full-text indexed; they are stored in the full text
	# index as is.
	#
	# a good example would be a forum posts table. one might need to search
	# through 'title' and 'content' fields but to limit search to specific
	# values of 'author_id', or 'forum_id', or to sort by 'post_date', or to
	# group matches by 'thread_id', or to group posts by month of the
	# 'post_date' and provide statistics.
	#
	# this all can be achieved by specifying all the mentioned columns
	# (excluding 'title' and 'content' which are full-text fields) as
	# attributes and then using API calls to setup filtering, sorting,
	# and grouping.
	#
	# sql_attr_uint is used to declare unsigned integer attributes.
	# sql_group_column is deprecated alias for sql_attr_uint.
	#
	# you can specify bit count for integer attributes by appending
	# ':BITCOUNT' to attribute name (see examples below). such bitfields
	# would be packed together in 32-bit chunks, to reduce storage space
	# requirements.
	#
	# sql_attr_bool is used to declare boolean attributes.
	# these are packed to 1 bit of storage (along with other bitfields).
	#
	# sql_attr_timestamp is used to declare UNIX timestamp attributes.
	# sql_date_column is deprecated alias for sql_attr_timestamp.
	#
	# sql_attr_str2ordinal is used to declare integer attributes whose
	# values are computed as ordinal numbers of corresponding column value
	# in sorted list of column values. WARNING, all such strings values
	# are going to be stored in RAM while indexing, and "C" locale will
	# be used when sorting!
	# sql_str2ordinal_column is deprecated alias for sql_attr_str2ordinal.
	#
	# sql_attr_float are used to declare float attributes. the values
	# are intended to be stored as "single", ie. in 32-bit IEEE format.
	#
	# there may be multiple attribute columns specified.
	# here's an example for that mentioned posts table:
	#
	# sql_attr_uint = author_id
	# sql_attr_uint = forum_id:9 # 9 bits for forum id
	# sql_attr_uint = thread_id
	# sql_attr_uint = country_id:12 # 12 bits for country id
	# sql_attr_timestamp = post_unix_timestamp
	# sql_attr_timestamp = last_edit_unix_timestamp
	# sql_attr_float = lat_radians
	# sql_attr_float = long_radians
	#
	# optional, default is empty
	sql_attr_uint			= group_id
	sql_attr_timestamp		= date_added
	# sql_attr_str2ordinal	= author_name


	# multi-valued attribute (MVA) columns
	#
	# plain attributes only allow to attach 1 value per each document.
	# however, there are cases (such as tags or categories) when it is
	# desired to attach multiple values of the same attribute and be able
	# to apply filtering to value lists.
	#
	# 'sql_multi_attr' option is used to declare such attributes.
	# its value format is as follows:
	#
	#	ATTR-TYPE ATTR-NAME 'from' SOURCE-TYPE [;QUERY] [;RANGE-QUERY]
	#
	# where
	# ATTR-TYPE is 'uint' or 'timestamp'
	# SOURCE-TYPE is 'field', 'query', or 'ranged-query'
	# QUERY is SQL query used to fetch all ( docid, attrvalue ) pairs
	# RANGE-QUERY is SQL query used to fetch min and max ID values, similar to 'sql_query_range'
	#
	# optional, default is empty

	# sql_attr_multi	= uint tag from query; SELECT id, tag FROM tags
	# sql_attr_multi	= uint tag from ranged-query; \
	#	SELECT id, tag FROM tags WHERE id>=$start AND id<=$end; \
